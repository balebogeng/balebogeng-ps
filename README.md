# Balebogeng Primary School website
 This project is aimed at revamping the website of Balebogeng Primary School
 (located in Mamelodi, Pretoria, South Africa) as part of a community 
 outreach programme, [JCP](https://www.up.ac.za/community-project-module)),
 headed by the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za).

This project also establishes a means for which other willing individuals may
contribute to the school's website.
